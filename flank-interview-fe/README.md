## Objective
in `src/components/CompanySizeFilters/company-size-filters.js`:

```
- Select a single item

- Deselect an item

- if "All" is selected, deselect all other items

- Select items in-between to create range.
  e.g. >$100B is selected and $10B-50B is clicked, then $50B-100B should also be selected.

- Selecting items in-between should work forwards and backwards

- Changing from Market Cap -> Book Value will clear all selections and select "All"
```
