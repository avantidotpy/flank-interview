## Objective

- Select a single item by adding it to the selected state, and applying CSS to indicate it is selected

- Deselect an item by removing it from the selected state, and removing the CSS

- if "All" is selected, deselect all other items and apply CSS to indicate it is selected

- Select items in-between to create range.
  e.g. $100 is selected and $400 is clicked, then $200 and $300 should also be selected.

- Selecting items in-between should work forwards and backwards.
  e.g. $400 is selected and $100 is clicked, then $200 and $300 should also be selected.
